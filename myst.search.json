Cookbooks are supported by a rich GitHub-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking to ensure reproducibility.\n\nParticipants in the Cook-off will develop their skills in contributing code and non-code to open source projects, demonstrating open science practices, and communicating and collaborating with other professionals. By doing so, they will grow the collection of accessible, reusable, and reproducible Cookbooks. This is a space for scientists, educators, and developers to bring their ideas, existing code, or rough notebooks and collaborate on turning them into community Cookbooks.","type":"content","url":"/#what-is-it","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Pythia Cook-off 2026","lvl2":"Who is this for?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#who-is-this-for","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Pythia Cook-off 2026","lvl2":"Who is this for?"},"content":"You!\nHackathon may be a scary word, but this event is for students, scientists, educators, engineers, hobbyists, professionals, and more across a spectrum of expertise and ability.\nFamiliarity with Python, git and GitHub, and Jupyter will help you best collaborate with others and best build your skills during the brief Hackathon period.\nCheck out \n\nPythia Foundations for a crash course in these topics.\nWe also encourage non-code participation through the creation of narrative text, images or GIFs, and even produced videos to support Cookbook content.\n\nPythia is committed to building a community for geoscientists to come together and share open source solutions.
